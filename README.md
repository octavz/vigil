## sbt project compiled with Scala 3

### Usage

This is a normal sbt project. You can compile code with `sbt compile`, run it with `sbt run`, and `sbt console` will start a Scala 3 REPL.

In order to run it pass the path to a text file containing the text to format. 
The output is redirected to the stdout but it can be easily returned from the function or sent to a file.
